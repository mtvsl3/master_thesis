# master_thesis
## Description
My masterâ€™s thesis investigates the [SPLEEN high-speed low-pressure (LPT) turbine]([/guides/content/editing-an-existing-page#modifying-front-matter](https://www.h2020-spleen.eu/)) using a spectral/hp element method framework Nektar++. The aim of the project was to evaluate accuracy, robustness and best-practice guidelines for using the Nektar++ compressible-flow solver on the SPLEEN LPT. The solver's performance was assesses through comparison with [experimental data](https://zenodo.org/records/13712768) and a RANS baseline from Star-CCM+, with particular focus on the influence of artificial viscosity in high-order discretisation.
